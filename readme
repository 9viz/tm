 tm
====

A simple "theme" manager in rust. It's stupidly simple to use.
You give tm a text file with 16 colors and a template file, tm
creates complete file out of the template and text file.

If for some reason, you want to add more than 16 colors,
you can do so by changing lib.rs file. But I will not
guarantee that it will work!

 building
==========

Grab cargo to compile tm. Good thing about tm is that it only
depends on the standard libraries, you don't need any other
external libraries at all!

After downloading cargo, run the following commands
(assuming that you're in the same path as tm's source)
`cargo install --path ./`

If you have setup cargo bin path correctly, it should've
installed it in your $PATH.

 running
=========

Basic usage:

To run tm, you do `tm /path/to/colors`. Nothing more,
nothing less. It's plain and simple.

enable verbose -> -v
help -> -h

 templates
===========

The template layout is slightly different from the python
version. Consequently, the colors file is slightly different
too. In this version, the colors file should not have a # in
the color definition. So #ffffff becomes ffffff

If the template files need a #, you mark the color as #Xn
where n is the nth color in the given file.
A typical template marker looks like this `color0="#X0"`

 exit codes
============

tm returns a variety of exit codes, all of them are given
below

1 - finished file couldn't be written
2 - template cache dir couldn't be created
3 - template couldn't be copied to template cache dir
4 - template cache dir couldn't be removed
5 - not enough arguments
6 - couldn't read template
7 - invalid path given

 env vars
==========

tm's template dir can be set using an env var. tm first
looks for TM_TEMPLATE_DIR, if it is not set, it falls
back to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tm, if $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not
set, it falls back to $HOME/.config/tm

 output dir
============

The finished files are stored in $XDG_CACHE_HOME/tm, if
$XDG_CACHE_HOME is not set, it falls back to $HOME/.cache/tm
