 tm
====

A simple "theme" manager in Rust. It's stupidly simple to use.
You give tm a text file with 16 colors and a template file, tm
creates complete file out of the template and text file.

 running
=========

Theoretically, it is possible to use this branch now. You can
use the functions in the template.rs file and create files
but a more user-friendly way will be made soon. Right now, I
ported 40% of tm's source to Rust.

 todo
======
A lot of stuff...
[ ] Refactor code
[ ] Add comments in write_to_template function in template.rs
[ ] Rewrite utils.py in Rust
